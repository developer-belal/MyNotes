# MyNotes
## Introduction
* My name is Bilal Blasmeh, a software engineer, I am 22 years old, a writer and critic, and I have some books on the official pages. I live in Jordan.

### The developer's mindset
* As a developer it's important to have a mindset and use it to avoid implementing unnecessary code or throwing it all away and starting over, and help you make a scalable secure program.

* Key points to master
Understand the purpose of of the software
If you don't understand the purpose you will write bad software
you are a designer
Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
Missunderstanding leads to complexity
It's simple, bad developers don't understand what they are doing.
Simplicity
* Don't act smart, be smart; good developers will simplify the code, bad developers will complicate it.
Complexity
Control the complexity of your softwar, but planning ahead, understading you software and ressisting unnecessary change.
Maintenance
Manage implementation of change, make your code more scalable by balancing between "ease" simplicity and "effort" complexity
Consistency
Code that is not consistent with it's naming and functionality is hard to understand.
Prioritizing
It's all about making decisions, but how? D=V/E.
Where D is desirablity, V is Value, E is the effort required. More value less effor is more disireable.

* Problem solving
Understand the problem, plan "but not too much planning", and then devide it into smaller tasks.
The good enough mentality
Don't chace for perfection first step. Start small, improve it, then extend.
Predictions
* You can't predict the future, instead be only as generic as you need to be right now.
Assumptions
Assumptions can kill softwares, design code base on what you know now.
Stop Reinventing
You already have a garbage collector why create a new one? Don't reinvent the wheel.
Resistance
* NO more code, until you are convinced that they are essential.
Automation
Repetitave is boring and a waste of time. Don't waste your time.
Code Measurment
Code lines isn't a way of measuring the progress and quality of a software.
Productivity
How can I remove more code mindset
* Testing
Test, test, test, and test again.
Underestimations
Break to smaller things that are easier to estimate rather than estimating one big thing as a whole and miss your deadline.
Rewriting code is a delusion
It's harder to read code than writing it.
Cases that are ok to rewrite code with.
Documentation and commenting
Commenting shouldn't describe what a code does, it should already be clear from the code itself. comments should mention why you wrote the code.
* Picking technologies
There are a lot of tools to use out there, try to reduce your dependency on them.
